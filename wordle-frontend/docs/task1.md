# Task 1: Normal wordle

This is just a normal wordle in React.

## Techniques in this task
1. bun - this is a js runtime to replace node. It's much, much faster, and it can run typescript directly.
2. vite - for react development and bundling
2. headlessui - I like to use the transition component in it to make animate. This is very quick and light.
3. tailwindcss - for styling. For most of quick projects, tailwindcss makes it much easier.
4. ahooks - I do like some of the hooks in ahooks. In my projects for company, I have the utils and hooks written by myself for security reason. But this time I will just call them from ahooks.
5. normal stuff - like react hooks, useState, useEffect, etc. I believe most of the developers are familiar with these.
6. cloudflare pages - for deploying. This is a free static webpage hosting service just like GitHub page. And I think it's much faster than GitHub page.

## Is there anything special in this task?

1. It's just a very simple and easy game. I think many developers can make it easily.
2. There is a requirement of configuration. I put them in the code instead of environment variables because I think actually it is meaningless changing that. I'm not sure if you want me to make it a state and allow the user to change it, but I do think it's meaningless. The game will not be more fun. Allow the user to upload their own list might also be interesting but that has increased the player's effort to start the game. In my opinion the best way is just what it is now.
3. Nothing else. Please enjoy the game :)


## Anything to improve?

In this project, I think the most important thing is to showcase that I am capable of the role so there are something that I have shifted to a lower priority.
1. UI design - While UI design is important, I've focused on demonstrating the core functionality and structure of the website. I'm confident in the site's ability to achieve its goals. With more time, I'd be happy to refine the aesthetics further.
2. Some UX improvement - There is also some small objects not finished yet. Like the keyboard, actually the different functionally keys should have different level, and also it will be good if there is an instruction for the game. But I think showing that I know these will be enough. The only thing we need after that is just the time.
3. .env file - You might have noticed I also put the .env file in the repository. It's not a common practice, but I think you might need it for testing. And it's all in the frontend code anyway.
